## 1. Installing WSL on Windos 10
Before even starting, we we were posed with a computational problem: the PCs provided by the Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) did not have storage capacities required for storing downloaded RNAseq data and perform computationally heavy tasks. Therefore, we downloaded the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on our own personal laptops to be able to perform our project. The documentation for how we set up our data science environment can be seen [here](WSLInstallation.md)

## 2. Downloading raw data and STAR alignment
